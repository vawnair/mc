#### AAC Config
#
# NOTE: Most of the values here have been tried and tested to work.
#       It is not recommended that you change them unless you are
#       getting false positives.
#
#       It would be a good idea to make sure the false positives you're getting aren't actually hackers....
#
#
# The configurable commands will replace "{player}" with the name of the player.
# You can run multiple commands on a single threshold by creating 2 entries with the same key:
#  thresholds:
#     10:
#      - "broadcast {player} was kicked for hacking"
#      - "kick {player} hacking"
#
# Be sure to check language.yml for configuration regarding staff chat, etc.
#
## If you need any help configuring AAC, or you're getting false positives and you don't know why, feel free to PM me on Spigot.
